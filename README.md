# ruby-CustomEnumerables
-----------
-----------
Objective:
---------------------------
The goal of this project was to reimplement and practise common methods used frequently through the enumerables module with objects like arrays and hashes. This project also helps familiarize user with how to work with blocks and procs (yield).

Functions Created:
---------------------------
- my_each (in Array class)

The below were in the Enumerables module, which had access to the Array class. 

- my_each_with_index
- my_select
- my_all?
- my_any?
- my_none?
- my_count
- my_map
- my_inject

This was a hard concept to grasp at first, but completing the first few made completing the rest much easier, and understanding, and appreciating the application of blocks and procs much more.
